\section{Introduction}
\vspace{1em}
The goal of the project is learning about different methods for control. Via experimenting and implementing what we have done in the pre-lab assignments for the mounted helicopter system. The system is manually controlled by using a joystick and will incorporate 4 different methods, including monovariable control, multivariable control, a Luenberger observer, and a Kalman filter. These methods will be analyzed in the context of their effectiveness in managing the helicopter's dynamics. In this report each method will be presented and the results from the lab assignments analyzed.
